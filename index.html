                        <p>Open Source Website Templates brings you some of the best designers to showcase their free website template designs. </p>    	<p>
                            Our Mission at Open Source Website Templates is to provide the highest quality, carefully selected free CSS and XHTML web templates available for your use. We encourage the use of our templates for business, personal, and non-profit websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because of our love for the environment and what it has to offer, our focus is on nature-inspired free website theme designs, along with other popular styles and templates. Our web templates are easy to navigate--all information is included in the design for simple use for your own needs. We seek submission for templates of all kinds, from photo blogs to online businesses to video downloading sites.
                        </p>
                        <p>We believe that simplicity is the key, both in the design as well as the ease of use. Our focus is on fresh, clear, and inspiring, and promote that in all of our designs. We want to create and distribute the best designs to meet your needs, all in a free interface that allows for your selection to be made as easily as possible for your website(s).</p>
                        <p>
                            All of our free websites are available for preview and download on our site. Simply click on the link that says "Preview" if you want to get a larger taste of what the site will offer you and click on "Download" to fully experience it for your own use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Though our website templates are free for your use, we will note that they are not allowed to be resold under any circumstances. Our developers and designers work hard to bring their fresh approach to the table, using top of the line CSS/XHTML, XHTL5, Dreamweaver, and other programs that allow for maximum versatility and beautiful designs.</p>
                        <p>
                            Our designers should get the recognition they deserve, so we do ask that you link back to the author who developed the template, along with a simple thank you for providing the design and code for your site.
                        </p>
                        <p>Open Source Website Templates is dedicated to bringing you free downloads of nature-inspired and simple designs, and we are pleased to have a gallery available for your use. Please don't hesitate to contact us with questions, comments, or submissions.</p>
